	abstract = {Feature interaction presents a challenge to feature selection for classification. A feature by itself may have little correlation with the target concept, but when it is combined with some other features, they can be strongly correlated with the target concept. Unintentional removal of these features can result in poor classification performance. Handling feature interaction can be computationally intractable. Recognizing the presence of feature interaction, we propose to efficiently handle feature interaction to achieve efficient feature selection and present extensive experimental results of evaluation.},

We review and analyze past approaches to feature selection and note their strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce and theoretically examine a new algorithm Rellef which selects relevant features using a statistical method. Relief does not depend on heuristics, is accurate even if features interact, and is noise-tolerant. It requires only linear time in the number of given features and the number of training instances, regardless of the target concept complexity. The algorithm also has certain limitations such as nonoptimal feature set size. Ways to overcome the limitations are suggested. We also report the test results of comparison between Relief and other feature selection algorithms. The empirical results support the theoretical analysis, suggesting a practical approach to feature selection for real-world problems.},

	abstract = {Feature selection is used in many application areas relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning, image processing, anomaly detection, bioinformatics and natural language processing. Feature selection based on information theory is a popular approach due its computational efficiency, scalability in terms of the dataset dimensionality, and independence from the classifier. Common drawbacks of this approach are the lack of information about the interaction between the features and the classifier, and the selection of redundant and irrelevant features. The latter is due to the limitations of the employed goal functions leading to overestimation of the feature significance. To address this problem, this article introduces two new nonlinear feature selection methods, namely Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) and Normalised Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (NJMIM); both these methods use mutual information and the ‘maximum of the minimum’ criterion, which alleviates the problem of overestimation of the feature significance as demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The proposed methods are compared using eleven publically available datasets with five competing methods. The results demonstrate that the JMIM method outperforms the other methods on most tested public datasets, reducing the relative average classification error by almost 6\% in comparison to the next best performing method. The statistical significance of the results is confirmed by the ANOVA test. Moreover, this method produces the best trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

In this paper, we propose a feature selection method exploiting the convergence properties of power series of matrices, and introducing the concept of inﬁnite feature selection (Inf-FS). Considering a selection of features as a path among feature distributions and letting these paths tend to an inﬁnite number permits the investigation of the importance (relevance and redundancy) of a feature when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. Ranking the importance individuates candidate features, which turn out to be effective from a classiﬁcation point of view, as proved by a thoroughly experimental section. The Inf-FS has been tested on thirteen diverse benchmarks, comparing against ﬁlters, embedded methods, and wrappers; in all the cases we achieve top performances, notably on the classiﬁcation tasks of PASCAL VOC 2007-2012.},

This paper defines and studies this bias. First, it is shown that any learning algorithm implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias requires {\textbackslash}Theta(  1  ffl ln  1  ffi +  1  ffl [2  p  +  p ln n]) training examples to guarantee PAC-learning a concept having p relevant features out of n available features. This bound is only logarithmic in the number of irrelevant features. The paper also presents a quasi-polynomial time algorithm, FOCUS, which implements MIN-FEATURES. Experimental studies are presented that compare FOCUS to the ID3 and FRINGE algorithms. These experiments show that--- contrary to expectations---these algorithms do not implement good approximations of MIN-FEATURES. The coverage, sample complexity, and generalization performance of FOCUS is substantially better than either ID3 or FRINGE on learning problems where the MIN-FEATURE...},

	abstract = {Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods. However, it selects each feature independently according to their scores under the Fisher criterion, which leads to a suboptimal subset of features. In this paper, we present a generalized Fisher score to jointly select features. It aims at finding an subset of features, which maximize the lower bound of traditional Fisher score. The resulting feature selection problem is a mixed integer programming, which can be reformulated as a quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP). It is solved by cutting plane algorithm, in each iteration of which a multiple kernel learning problem is solved alternatively by multivariate ridge regression and projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher score as well as many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

Furthermore, the number of dimensions of the space used to determine the plane is minimized. In the support vector machine approach [27, 7, 1, 10, 24, 28], in addition to minimizing the weighted sum of distances of misclassified points to the bounding planes, we also maximize the distance between the two bounding planes that generate the separating plane.

	abstract = {Feature importance ranking has become a powerful tool for explainable AI. However, its nature of combinatorial optimization poses a great challenge for deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-net architecture consisting of operator and selector for discovery of an optimal feature subset of a fixed size and ranking the importance of those features in the optimal subset simultaneously. During learning, the operator is trained for a supervised learning task via optimal feature subset candidates generated by the selector that learns predicting the learning performance of the operator working on different optimal subset candidates. We develop an alternate learning algorithm that trains two nets jointly and incorporates a stochastic local search procedure into learning to address the combinatorial optimization challenge. In deployment, the selector generates an optimal feature subset and ranks feature importance, while the operator makes predictions based on the optimal subset for test data. A thorough evaluation on synthetic, benchmark and real data sets suggests that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art feature importance ranking and supervised feature selection methods.

Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

The âstabilityâ of a feature selection algorithm refers to the robustness of its feature preferences, with respect to data sampling and to its stochastic nature.

Whilst the idea is simple, quantifying this has proven more challenging---we note numerous proposals in the literature, each with different motivation and justification. We present a rigorous statistical treatment for this issue. In particular, with this work we consolidate the literature and provide (1) a deeper understanding of existing work based on a small set of properties, and (2) a clearly justified statistical approach with several novel benefits. This approach serves to identify a stability measure obeying all desirable properties, and (for the first time in the literature) allowing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on the stability, enabling rigorous experimental comparison of feature selection algorithms.},
